## 🚀 About Me

I’m a seasoned IT leader with a proven track record delivering complex transformations across governance, service operations, infrastructure, security, and agile environments. With hands-on experience managing global systems, cross-functional teams, and enterprise-scale initiatives, I bridge the gap between strategic vision and technical execution.

My work is rooted in frameworks like ITIL, COBIT, ISO and DevOps, but always tailored to **pragmatic, high-impact delivery**. I’ve led mission-critical initiatives involving 24/7 operations, regulatory compliance, system integration, and continuous improvement — always with an emphasis on **risk mitigation, scalability, performance**, and **business alignment**.

Whether enabling business continuity, maturing service levels, or unlocking faster value through agile practices, I bring **clarity to complexity**, helping teams, leaders, and organizations evolve confidently in high-demand environments.
